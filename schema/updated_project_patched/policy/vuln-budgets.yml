# Vulnerability Budgets Policy (issue 13)
#
# This policy defines acceptable vulnerability levels for
# dependencies used in this repository. The CI pipeline should
# enforce that no component exceeds these budgets. Severity is as
# defined by the CVSS rating.

budgets:
  critical: 0   # zero critical vulnerabilities allowed
  high:     0   # zero high vulnerabilities allowed
  medium:   5   # up to five medium vulnerabilities allowed
  low:      10  # up to ten low vulnerabilities allowed

exceptions:
  # specify known-vulnerable packages and a rationale for temporary
  # allowance. Include an expiry date.
  # example:
  # - package: "example-lib"
  #   severities: ["high"]
  #   rationale: "Used in testing only; patched in next release"
  #   expires: "2026-01-01"

# Compatibility matrix for plugins and runtime (issue 3)
#
# This file declares the supported contract ranges and runtime
# environments for each plugin. The CI pipeline validates that
# declarations in plugin manifests conform to these ranges. Add
# entries here whenever you create a new plugin or update its
# compatibility. Values under each plugin key should reflect the
# contract API range and the supported language/runtime versions.

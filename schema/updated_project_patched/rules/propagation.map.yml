# Propagation rules map for docs.propagate (issue 1)
#
# When upstream documents change, these rules describe which downstream
# documents should be updated and how. Each rule identifies an
# upstream "doc_key" and provides a list of downstream targets with
# operations to perform. These rules are consumed by the docs.propagate
# plugin to compute and apply changes. Adjust or extend as you add
# more documents to your system.

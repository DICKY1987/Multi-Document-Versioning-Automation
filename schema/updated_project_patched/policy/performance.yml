# Performance SLO & Concurrency Policy (issue 27)
#
# Defines service level objectives (SLOs) for operation latency,
# memory usage, and throughput. It also establishes a concurrency
# model for handlers.

budgets:
  latency_ms:
    default: 1000         # operations should complete within 1s
    max: 5000             # hard limit before timing out
  memory_mb:
    default: 128          # expected memory usage for a handler
    max: 512              # maximum allowed memory
  throughput_ops_per_sec:
    default: 10           # expected sustained operations per second

concurrency:
  model: "per-op"
  default_concurrency: 1
  max_concurrency: 5
  scaling:
    strategy: "fixed"
    note: |
      Future versions may introduce adaptive concurrency based on
      load and resource availability.

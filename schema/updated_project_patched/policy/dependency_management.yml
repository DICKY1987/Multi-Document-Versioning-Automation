# Inter-Plugin Dependency Management Policy (issue 26)
#
# This policy defines how plugins may declare dependencies on other
# plugins and kernel versions. It prevents circular and conflicting
# dependencies and helps the kernel resolve load order.

dependencies:
  syntax:
    # Each plugin may declare a `depends_on` field in its
    # manifest listing required plugins with version ranges.
    # Example: depends_on:
    #   DOCS_VERSIONING: ">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"
    key: version_range

conflict_resolution:
  - Circular dependencies are forbidden; the kernel must detect
    cycles and abort initialization.
  - Version conflicts (ranges that do not intersect) cause an
    error at plugin load time.

kernel_dependency:
  # Plugins may specify a required kernel API version using
  # `requires_kernel: ">=1.0 <2.0"` in their manifest. The kernel
  # verifies compatibility at load time.

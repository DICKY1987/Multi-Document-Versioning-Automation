# Configuration Management Policy (issue 28)
#
# Defines where configuration parameters live, their precedence, and
# how they are reloaded. Sensitive configuration values (secrets)
# must follow the secrets policy.

sources_precedence:
  - environment_variables
  - plugin_config_file
  - plugin_defaults
  - kernel_defaults

format:
  preferred: "yaml"
  allowed: ["json", "toml"]

hot_reload:
  supported: true
  mechanism: |
    Plugins must watch their configuration files for changes and
    reload state via `activate()` and `deactivate()` methods.

sensitive_fields:
  prefix: "secret_"
  # any configuration key starting with this prefix will be treated
  # as secret and redacted in logs and snapshots.
